Created for Mosaic (mosaic-solutions.co). Mosaic provides tailored care solutions and resources to help caregivers of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's or other memory-related disorders create and implement personalized care plans for their loved ones.

## What it does

Takes a Typeform questionnaire as an input. Based on the answers, builds a profile with a reading list of articles from the proprietary Mosaic knowledge base and includes referral links to memory care providers (adult home care, adult day care, full residential facilities). It outputs the care plan as an email.
